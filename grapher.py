# A little bit to get you started
#   Note: This should only require around ~20-ish
#       lines of code, don't make this a full
#       blown project, just draw me a graph :)
#   If you are having trouble:
#       1) Google the modeules for documentation
#            (they have good examples)
#       2) Ask me questions! :)

# This module can help you run a program from
#  your Python script and capture the output
#  from standard out (the values you need to plot)
import subprocess

# This module is a simple graphing module for
#   Python. We don't need anything too fancy
#   here, just the line chart as shown on the
#   website. This module can do way more if you
#   need graphs for other projects/research
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def main():
    # Write your code here and delete this comment
    # and the pass statement
    pass
